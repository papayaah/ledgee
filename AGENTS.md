# Agent Development Guidelines

## Do NOT:
- Run development servers (`npm run dev`, `npm start`, etc.)
- Create extensive test files
- Write verbose documentation
- use emoticons, instead use any icons from react-icons as needed

## DO:
- Keep code concise and focused
- Make minimal, targeted changes
- Let the user run their own servers
- Focus on solving the immediate problem

## Notes:
- User will handle server execution
- Prefer small, efficient solutions
- Avoid over-engineering
